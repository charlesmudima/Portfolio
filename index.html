                    <p>
                        I am currently studying towards a BSc Honors in Geoinformatics at Stellenbosch. 
                        Originally from Zimbabwe, I grew up in South Africa and have been living here for 
                        the past 15 years. I pride myself on being flexible, a fast learner, and having the
                        ability to prioritize my workload and get things done. Over the years, I have grown 
                        to love public speaking, GIS, entrepreneurship, and aviation.

                                GIT713 provides an introduction to professionalism, ethics, legislation, strategy, and implementation in 
                                the geographic information system industry. These principles are taught through a project implementation and 
                                class presentations. Additionally, the module offers an understanding of data management and quality. In my 
                                experience with GIT713, I have found that the module aims to provide a practical understanding of professional 
                                practice in the GIS industry. It covers a range of topics, including GIS Strategy and Implementation, 
                                Professionalism and Ethics, Business Communication, Project and Software Development, GIS Data Management, 
                                and a Botanical Garden group project. It is important to note that the GIS industry is composed of various 
                                components. The mind map below illustrates some of the important and helpful components I have encountered in this course.
                                The mind map illustrates core components that have been fundamental and helpful in my GIT713 journey. 
                                These principles will assist me in my future career as a GIS professional. It's worth noting that the 
                                components shown on the mind map can overlap or be related to each other. For instance, human resources are 
                                essential in the GIS industry, and effective communication is necessary to maximize this resource. This aspect 
                                was crucial to the progression of our botanical project.

                                Botanical Garden Project

                            <p>
                                For this project, we collaborated with Dr. Kirkwood the botanical garden’s curator to develop a prototype map.
                                As a group, we had to understand the client's requirements and implement the principles of project management, 
                                GIS strategy, and software development.This project allowed us to apply the theoretical principles we learned in 
                                class and utilize our skills and knowledge. Initially, it was challenging to understand the client's needs, but 
                                frequent consultations with our client and supervisors helped us overcome this challenge.
    
                                In the first phase, we developed a conceptual design based on the client's requirements and the available 
                                resources and tools. We identified the following software and tools to aid us in solving the client's problem: 
                                ArcGIS Pro, Leaflet, ArcGIS Online, Excel, QGIS, and Visual Studio Code.

                                To plan our project, we divided our map functionalities into core, secondary, and tertiary functionalities. 
                                This approach helped us understand and strategize our project solution. We also utilized a Gantt chart to complete 
                                our project and interim deliverables. This tool helped us focus on the different phases of the project.
                                After completing the conceptual design, we focused on the logical design phase. During this phase, we constructed a
                                database prototype to demonstrate how the data would be stored and how the different attributes of the botanical 
                                garden would be linked. This phase allowed me to appreciate the concept of database management, as I learned how to 
                                organize and structure data effectively. In the later stages of the project, we focused on finalizing our product and 
                                ensuring that we met the goals we had set for ourselves. Figure 4 illustrates the final map that we developed during 
                                the project. As we approached the end of the project life cycle, we noted that we had successfully completed the core 
                                functionalities for the prototype. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of some of the functionalities, 
                                we were unable to implement all of the secondary and tertiary functionalities that we had originally planned.

                                Project Management
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Project management is another key component that I identified as important in my GIT713 course. Project management is 
                                defined as a temporary process that requires a set of tangible and intangible resources to achieve a specific set of 
                                objectives or goals. Working on the botanical project made me value project management as a practice and skill. 
                                Implementing the theory of project management into practice was not easy, but it was a valuable learning experience.

                                Project management consists of various components, namely organization, objectives, project team, and goals. 
                                In our botanical project, we tried to define and accommodate all the components that define project management.
                                We also implemented the five different steps in project management: 1) Initiation, 2) Planning, 3) Execution, 
                                4) Monitoring and Control, and 5) Closure.
                                
                                One important aspect I learned in project management was that a team can make or break a project. The team is at
                                the center of any project, and their capabilities and abilities greatly influence the outcome of the project. 
                                Another important aspect of project management is the project leader. In our botanical group, we did not have a 
                                leader, as we all knew our roles and responsibilities. However, in most projects, a project manager is necessary to 
                                allocate competent individuals to specific tasks, hold people accountable, and ensure that the team is working as 
                                efficiently as possible.

                            <p>
                                Over the past decade, the GIS industry has experienced significant growth due to advances in technology and greater 
                                access to data, among other factors. This growth has brought principles such as GIS strategy and implementation to 
                                the forefront, with the aim of successfully integrating GIS practices into organizations. To achieve this, GIS strategy
                                and implementation requires a vision, strategy, and roadmap. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is an integrated collection 
                                of computer software and data used to view and manage information about geographic places, analyze spatial relationships, and 
                                model spatial processes. GIS provides a framework for gathering and organizing spatial data and related information, enabling it 
                                to be displayed and analyzed. Strategic planning for the management of geographic information is an ongoing process that requires 
                                a comprehensive, long-term perspective to provide focus and direction for more detailed tactical planning over time.

                                Software development is the practice of utilising various programming languages to create software. 
                                Software development is a very broad field and can be broken down into three main categories: web development, 
                                mobile development and desktop development. During the GIT713 course, I had the opportunity to work with various 
                                software programs. One of the data wrangling tasks involved creating a voter's turnout map for the Western Cape 
                                province using ArcPy and R-Studio, which allowed me to expand and improve my coding skills in Python. I found this 
                                task interesting and relatable.

                                Additionally, the lecture on software product development by Juan was another valuable aspect of the course. 
                                As someone with a background in computer science, it solidified my understanding and knowledge of software development. 
                                I was pleased to discover that the same principles I learned in my CS344 module can be applied in the GIS industry.

                                Software development often involves different people working together, making it a team effort that requires effective 
                                communication and coordination. This component also highlights the importance of human resources. Through software 
                                development, I learned about the need for clear and concise communication, which aligns with the 7 C's of communication 
                                (Completeness, Concreteness, Courtesy, Correctness, Clarity, Consideration, Conciseness). I also gained knowledge of SCRUM
                                as an agile project management technique.

                            <p>
                                Although I found the professionalism and ethics section to be the least enjoyable part of the course due to the 
                                extensive literature and theory we covered, I recognized its significance in the GIS industry. This module taught 
                                me the importance of conducting oneself professionally and adhering to ethical principles in the workplace. Moreover, 
                                it reinforced the notion that knowledge is power, particularly when it comes to laws and regulations governing data.

                                The professionalism and ethics section covered several topics, including the South African Geomatics Council (SAGC), 
                                the seven processes for ethical decision-making, and moral case studies. As we embark on our professional journeys, 
                                these topics proved to be very enlightening and crucial. The seven-step process for ethical decision-making, in particular, 
                                stood out to me as a valuable takeaway from this section. The process involves:
                                
                                Step 1: State the problem
                                Step 2: Check the facts
                                Step 3: Identify relevant factors
                                Step 4: Develop a list of options
                                Step 5: Test the options
                                Step 6: Make a choice based on Steps 1-5
                                Step 7: Review Steps 1-6
